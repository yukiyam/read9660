read9660
========

read9660 reads an ISO-9660 image and dumps down the file system layout.
As for now it supports pure ISO-9660 only (no Joliet).

Currently this program is in early development stage and it has got very limited
number of functions.


Features:

- Supports both 2048 and 2352 bytes/block images.
- Supports CD-ROM XA extension.
- Tries to find the file system even on images extracted from the 2nd or 
  later track of the disc (such as CD-EXTRA).
    - Well, it 'tries', and sometimes it may fail unfortunately...


Usage:

> read9660 <iso-file>

This dumps the file system and prints every file's first logical block address
(in sectors) and its size (in bytes), along with some other informations.
